# Prework-Study-Guide

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
I was motivated to do this because not only can i help other computer science students, I learn through helping them and practice my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Why did you build this project? 
As a student learning computer science, i understand the frustration of taking notes especially taking organized notes and keeping everything neat in a way you can later look back on and really consume information.
- What problem does it solve?
It solves having messy notes that you cant even grasp information from and breaks down each topic into their own notes. 
- What did you learn?
I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also learned how to use and naviagate the terminal and use github.

## Installation

First, We started off with Front-end work such as HTML and CSS in order to set a structure. Then we used JavaScript to give our structure a purpose.

## Usage

First, you navigate to which topic you are learning. Then you can either go to the browser and read the notes you currently have on that topic or you can go to the html file and add your own notes in the unordered lists by adding a list item and saving it.

## How to Contribute
 
 Anyone can contribute by adding notes on to each topic so future and current computer science students have a lot of information to work with. (They have to be approved by me of course before any changes occur)
